                    Utilities test their water and report the results to the EPA.
                    In principle, anyone can look those results up. In practice,
                    the data lives in systems most people will never open, in a
                    format that assumes you already understand maximum contaminant
                    levels, sampling regimes, and certification standards.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    WaterQualityLens exists to close that gap. We take the same
                    public municipal data and present it plainly — every value
                    with its source, every uncertainty labeled, every
                    recommendation traceable to an independent certification. Our
                    measure of success is simple: you leave knowing more than you
                    did, and trusting that what you were told is exactly what the
                    record says.
